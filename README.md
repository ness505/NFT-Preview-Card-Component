## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

This is how it should look like

Also it has active states that should look like this

It needs to have a responsive design.
